# Diabetes-Disease-Detection-with-XG-Boost-and-Neural-Networks
In this project-based course, we will build, train and test a machine learning model to detect diabetes with XG-boost and Artificial Neural Networks. The objective of this project is to predict whether a patient has diabetes or not based on their given features and diagnostic measurements such as number of pregnancies, insulin levels, Body mass index, age and blood pressure.
