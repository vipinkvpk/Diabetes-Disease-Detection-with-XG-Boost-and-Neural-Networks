# Diabetes-Disease-Detection-with-XG-Boost-and-Neural-Networks
In this project-based course, we will build, train and test a machine learning model to detect diabetes with XG-boost and Artificial Neural Networks. The objective of this project is to predict whether a patient has diabetes or not based on their given features and diagnostic measurements such as number of pregnancies, insulin levels, Body mass index, age and blood pressure.
Learning Objectives
Perform Data Visualization and Exploratory Data Analysis
Train an ANN and XG-Boost algorithms to solve classification type problems
Build, Train and Test XG-Boost and Artificial Neural Networks Model
